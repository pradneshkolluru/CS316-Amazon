# TEAM DATA DAWGS - Bark Boutique

Our group has opted to complete the Standard Mini-Amazon Project.
We have also decided to get graded as a group.

### The Pack
##### Divya Nataraj, Gargi Mahadeshwar, Lindsay Liu, Soumya Bodavula, Pradnesh Kolluru


## Running Website

1. run `./install.sh`.  This will install a bunch of things, set
   up an important file called `.flashenv`, and creates a simple
   PostgreSQL database named `amazon`.
2. Issue the following Commands
```
poetry shell
flask run
```
3. If you use containers on your own laptop, point your browser to
  http://localhost:8080/
4. To stop your app, type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> in the container
shell; that will take you back to the command-line prompt, still
inside the `poetry` environment. If you are all done with this app for
now, you can type `exit` to get out of the `poetry` environment and
get back to the normal container shell
